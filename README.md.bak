# Catchup
Catchup is a simple node package made with pure JavaScript

## Description
Catchup produces a random 6 digit and alphabetical character (by default) as a string to be read by human beings.
Users must enter the exact match of the characters generated to become validated as a non-robotic user.

# Setup
``` shell
$ npm install catchup
```

# How it works
## Get a captcha
``` javascript
import catchup from "catchup";
const captcha = new catchup({
					stringLength: 6,
					lineNoise: 25,
					dotNoise: 150,
					})

let captchaData = captcha.draw();
```

The draw() method returns an object contains "code" and "imageData" as the example below:

``` javascript
{code: 'OTJ8U1', imageData: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAASwAâ€¦LmbVC6xICfjElY2KTsV/8P0j3QF9cHWJSAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'}
```

Then you can use 'imageData' property to use as source of image tag like this:

``` javascript
document.getElementById("captchaImage").src = captchaData.imageData;
```

``` html
<img src="" id="captchaImage" />
```


## Get a captcha in image as byte array
* To get a generated random captcha image, use GetAnImageCaptchaInByteArray() method.
This method returns an object which contains a captcha string and a byte array that you can use directly in image tag.

## Examples in UI
* Example in html pages:
-> \<img style="width:500px;" src='data:image/png;base64, ' + imageInByteArray" />

* Example in razor pages:
-> <img style="width:500px;" src="@String.Format("data:image/png;base64,{0}", Convert.ToBase64String(imageInByteArray))" />"

## Solve the captcha
* To validate user as a non-robotic one, use CheckCaptcha(string riddle, string solution).
This method accepts two required arguments as the riddle and solution of it. the first one is the string you got from GetACaptcha() method and the second one (solution) is the number user sends as the answer. the method returns a boolean which determines if the answer is correct or not.

# Important
It is obvious that to prevent from attacks, you better store the generated captcha with the user who is requesting for it, so the attacker can't send you the similar riddle and his solution. This package is not doing it as it maybe differences in different project flows.

Of course that this package is not perfect and can be extended in many ways. Please FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE, DEVELOP AND FIX BUGS by a pull request. I'd be glad to hear your suggestions or anything else from you through alireza_mortezaei@hotmail.com
